         Here’s a text-based wiring diagram for ATtiny85 + DFPlayer Mini + Button + LED:

ATtiny85 Pinout (DIP-8):
         +---\/---+
  PB5  1 |        | 8  VCC
  PB3  2 |        | 7  PB2
  PB4  3 |        | 6  PB1
  GND  4 |        | 5  PB0
         +-------+


Connections:

VCC (pin 8) → 3.3V or 5V power
GND (pin 4) → Ground
DFPlayer Mini:

VCC → 3.3V or 5V power
GND → Ground
RX → ATtiny85 TX (PB3, pin 2) via 1k–2.2k resistor
TX → ATtiny85 RX (PB0, pin 5)
BUSY → ATtiny85 PB4 (pin 3)
Button:

One side → ATtiny85 PB2 (pin 7)
Other side → GND
LED (with resistor, e.g., 220Ω):

Anode (+) → ATtiny85 PB1 (pin 6)
Cathode (–) → GND
Speaker/Amplifier:

Connect to DFPlayer Mini speaker outputs
Decoupling Capacitors:

100nF ceramic: ATtiny85 VCC ↔ GND (close to chip)
10μF electrolytic: Near amplifier power
